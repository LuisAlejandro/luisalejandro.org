                  Dockershelf is a repository that serves as a collector for
                  docker recipes that are universal, efficient and slim. We keep
                  adding &quot;shelves&quot;, which are holders for the
                  different versions of a popular language or application.
                  Images are updated, tested and published weekly via a Github
                  Actions workflow.

                    applications. I started using{" "}
                    
                    <b className="font-black">docker</b>, but at the time all
                    docker images were based on debian stable or ubuntu. The
                    first had legacy software, and the latter was too unstable
                    to be used in production. I needed at least a{" "}

                    images for different versions. I also needed to build node

                    I came up with a way to automate the build process using
                    Travis CI. I created templates for the pipeline
                    configuration, which would create the actual configuration
                    containing the list of images to build. I could control the
                    specific versions of python or node to build, depending on
                    its popularity and availability of the software in the
                    debian repositories. I experienced a setback when Travis CI
                    became a paid service, so I had to migrate to Github
                    Actions.

                    to write my CV. I needed them to be based on debian sid for
                    development purposes but I later added a Debian stable
                    version for production. Initially they were all amd64 images
                    but I later added arm64 for mac users.

                    I created a test suite for the images, which would run on

                    built correctly and that the software was installed and
                    working. The builds are run weekly, and the images are

                    The difference in size between the official images and the
                    dockershelf ones are significant. The Python and Node images
                    are 4 times smaller, making them faster to download and use.
                    Although not as small as Alpine, they are still a good
                    alternative for those who need a Debian based image.
